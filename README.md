Bike sharing systems have gained popularity over the past decade. Because of their accessibility and affordability, more than 500 bike sharing programs are running around the world to provide a low-cost alternative for short-term commutes and to help alleviate traffic. As bike sharing demands increase, unavailability and uneven distribution of bikes become a critical issue for the programs, which could undermine users’ experience and waste public resources. In this project, we joined a Kaggle competition to create a better way of predicting the daily bike sharing demands in Washington, D.C. We used random forests (of regression trees) to best predict the number of bikes that will be rented for a given hour. We built our prototype models in R and leveraged Spark to handle massive amounts of data. Our best model so far has reached a pseudo R2 of 0.96 and our best submission ranked among the top 36% of all models on Kaggle’s leaderboard.

##Instruction 
To reproduce the result in R, please set the directory under the "[your path]/Bike-Share_Demand_Public". Notice that the prediction stage could take quite a bit of time. If you have any question, feel free to contact us!
