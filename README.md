Bike sharing systems have gained popularity over the past decade. Because of their accessibility and affordability, more than 500 bike sharing programs are running around the world to provide a low-cost alternative for short-term commutes and to help alleviate traffic. As bike sharing demands increase, un- availability and uneven distribution of bikes become a critical issue for the programs, which could undermine users’ expe- rience and waste public resources. In this project, we joined a Kaggle competition to create a better way of predicting the daily bike sharing demands in Washington, D.C. We used ran- dom forests (of regression trees) to best predict the number of bikes that will be rented for a given hour. We built our pro- totype models in R and leveraged Spark to handle massive amounts of data. Our best model so far has reached a pseudo R2 of 0.96 and our best submission ranked among the top 36% of all models on Kaggle’s leaderboard.
